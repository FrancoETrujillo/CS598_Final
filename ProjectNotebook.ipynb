    "The paper focuses on 2 main problems; Mortality Prediction and Phenotype Classification\n",
    "### What is the importance/meaning of solving the problem: \n",
    "ICUs admit patients with life-threatening conditions, Improving the efficacy and efficiency of predictions by accounting for irregular data in EHRs can help the medical providers to make more accurate and quick decisions that could save lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the difficulty of the problem:\n",
    "The primary difficulty is the handling the irregular sampling of data and the effective integration and modeling of EHR records like numerical time series and textual notes taken in multiple points in time and frequencies.\n",

    "## Paper explanation\n",
    "### What did the paper propose\n",
    "The general problem addressed in this paper is to find a better approach to handling irregular multimodal data obtained on EHRs to better assess real-time predictions in ICUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the innovations of the method\n",
    "To better approach irregularity and multi-modal data the paper proposes integrating the real-time series and clinical notes while considering their irregularities. This by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modeling Irregularity in Time Series: \n",
    "    - Temporal Discretization-Based Embeddings (TDE): Utilizes a novel unified approach (UTDE) that combines: \n",
    "        - Imputation: Regularizes time series by filling in missing values based on prior observations or statistical methods. \n",
    "        - Discretized Multi-Time Attention (mTAND): Applies a learned interpolation method using a multi-time attention mechanism to represent the irregular time series data better. \n",
    "    - Unified Approach (UTDE): This approach integrates imputation and mTAND through a gating mechanism to dynamically combine the representation of the time series. \n",
    "     \n",
    " \n",
    "- Processing Irregular Clinical Notes: \n",
    "    - Text Encoding: Uses a pretrained model (TextEncoder) to encode clinical notes into a series of representations. \n",
    "    - Irregularity Modeling: Sorts these representations by time, treats them as Multivariate Irregularly Sampled Time Series (MINSTS), and employs mTAND to generate a set of text interpolation representations to handle irregularities. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- Multimodal Fusion: \n",
    "    - Interleaved Attention Mechanism: Fuses time series and clinical note representations across temporal steps, integrating irregularity into multimodal representations. \n",
    "    - Self and Cross-Attention: \n",
    "        - Multi-Head Self-Attention (MH): Acquires contextual embeddings for each modality by focusing within the same modality across time. \n",
    "        - Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMH): Each modality learns from the other, integrating information across modalities. \n",
    "    - Feed-Forward and Prediction Layers: A feed-forward sublayer follows the CMH outputs, with layer normalization and residual connections applied. The final step involves passing the integrated representations through fully connected layers to predict the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How well the proposed method work (in its own metrics)\n",
    " The proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-ofthe-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. \n",
    "Observing a relative improvements of 6.5%, 3.6%, and 4.3% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the contribution to the reasearch regime (referring the Background above, how important the paper is to the problem).\n",
    "The paper's contribution is important because it provides a new direction for EHR-based predictive models to consider time irregularity that could lead to more accurate and reliable medical predictions, helping patients and healthcare processes."
